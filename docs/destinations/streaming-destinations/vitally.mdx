## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review the spec, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

rudderanalytics.identify('userId123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@yourcustomer.com',
  avatar: 'https://yourdomain.com/avatars/johndoe.png',
  role: 'CEO'
});
```

Identify calls are used by Vitally to maintain a picture of a single user. The traits you pass to the Identify call will be displayed on the user's dashboard and can be used for sorting and filtering users within an account and across all of your users.

Passing along the following traits will correspond to what is displayed in Vitally:
  * `name` is used to set the name of the user in Vitally
  * `email` sets the user's email in Vitally
  * `avatar` is used to display an avatar for the user
